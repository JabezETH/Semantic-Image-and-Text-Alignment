<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Business objective

Recent advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, alongside the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), have ushered in a new era of capabilities in the digital domain. These technologies enable the intricate processing and interpretation of data, facilitating the creation of detailed, dynamic content that bridges the gap between textual concepts and visual storytelling. The integration of these technologies not only simplifies the translation of complex ideas into tangible visuals but also enhances creativity and efficiency in content generation. The business objective of the challenge is to harness these capabilities to transform textual descriptions of advertisement concepts and assets into detailed storyboards. This transformation process aims to visually depict the narrative flow and user interaction within advertisements, making the conceptualization of digital campaigns both more intuitive and impactful.
Adludio is at the forefront of online mobile advertising, specialising in the creation of interactive ads that resonate with viewers through dynamic content such as mini-games, videos, texts, and images. Adludio offers its clients a suite of services designed to maximise engagement and campaign performance:
Collection of comprehensive briefs detailing brand identity, advertising objectives, guidelines, KPIs, objectives, and budget.
Design of interactive advertisements, leveraging a rich media creative toolkit.
Distribution of these creatives to targeted audiences via sophisticated real-time bidding for impressions on the open market.
Optimization of the creative design and targeting process through advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure maximum impact.

In this transformative era of advertising and recognizing the potential for technology to streamline and enhance the ad creation process, Adludio is embarking on an ambitious initiative to automate the end-to-end process of advertising production. This automation aims to significantly expedite the ideation and execution phases, enabling clients to swiftly launch their campaigns with minimal expenditure of time and resources. A key component of this automation involves the generation of potential creative concepts based on the client's brief. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, Adludio intends to present clients with viable creative options rapidly, thereby reducing the traditional turnaround time from over a week to mere days. Your task, as part of this transformative process, is to architect and develop a cutting-edge machine learning solution that automates the conversion of textual advertisement concepts, assets descriptions into visually compelling storyboards. This solution should intelligently interpret the provided concepts and assets, generate relevant visual and textual assets, compose these assets into individual ad frames, and ultimately synthesize a cohesive storyboard that encapsulates the essence of the proposed ad campaign.
